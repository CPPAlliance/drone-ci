A CPPAlliance hosted [Drone](https://www.drone.io/) server for Boost libraries.  
  
### Instructions:  
  
If you are a Boost author, follow these steps to get started.  

- Visit https://drone.cpp.al
- "Authorize Drone". Click the "Authorize cppalliance-drone" button.  
- Sync repositories. Click the "sync" button.  
- A list of repositories will appear. For each repo, click and then choose "Activate Repository".  
- In the settings page, change Configuration from .drone.yml to .drone.star. "Save".  
  
The drone files must be present in the target branch, so merge .drone.star into "develop" if you have not already done so.  
  
Push a new commit or submit a pull request to trigger a build in drone.  
  

The .drone.star file uses [the starlark language](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/language.html). Starlarkâ€™s syntax is inspired by (and nearly identical to) Python3. This allows great flexibility when creating a config file.  

### More Information:

- asan jobs require privileged access, and will show an error about "LeakSanitizer does not work under ptrace".  Add an argument "privileged=True" to linux_cxx() in the .drone.star file. 
  
- If one of the jobs shows an error about requiring privileged access in the Drone UI, contact an administrator to increase privileges for the docker container.

- "What does DRONE_JOB_UUID mean and where does one get one?" It doesn't mean anything, but should be unique. They were initially generated by taking a SHA1 hash of the "job number", such as "1" or "2". You could literally use "1" or "2" if you preferred. The point is to have an identifier to distinguish the job so that in the other drone scripts you could conditionally run a step for only one of the jobs if the UUID matches. 

- "What are the files with the funny hex numbers?" These drone files were generated with an automated script based on travis.yml. The most common job configuration was detected and called "boost.sh". It's often the main script. For other configurations, if the "install" and "script" portions of the job varied, then they were named based on their sha1 hash value, such as .drone/840114c2a5-fda7c76df5.sh, with .drone.star using the "buildtype" field to reference it. You may optionally change these names to something more meaningful than a hash.
